# Workshop_MVC_Express
Express en mode MVC avec BDD Mysql

## Objectif
The goal of the workshop is to implement a Express APP with a MVC LIKE Model step by step
In a second time, we will try to implement Authentification with JWT and middleware

## Start
Git clone your project and copy the .env-sample to a .env.... and fill the variable with yours

## Part 1 => MVC Like
- 1/ Create an express serveur with an `app.js `file as entry point
- 2/ Create the DB with the SQL file
- 3/ Configure your connection with a `db-config.js` file and the package *dotenv* and *mysql2*
- 4/ Setup your route in a route folder
- 5/ Create a model folder with a model file in it (Get the name of the table)
- 6/ Create the GET route, using your model to get the data with promise (.then, .catch)
- 7/ Create the GET by Id route, using your model file as on top.
- 8/ Improve your GET route with params (?type=""&ph="")

## Part 2 => Middleware and Auth with JWT
- 1/ Create a new file `auth.js` in the route folder and add a post method on */signin*
    - Create a new table for the user with an unique *id*, unique *email* and *hashedpassword*
    - Create a function to hash the password with `Ã rgon` in the `auth.js` router file
    - Insert into the table the *email* and *hashedpassword* (Check the error as email already exist, and so on);
    We can now register ourself!!! Now, can we login
- 2/ In the same file, add a */login* route.
      - Create a find one method to get the *password*from the *email* in an user model file. If the email doesn't exist, stop the process with a correct message
      - Otherwise, compare the *hashpassword* with the plain password from the body
      - If true => send a connected connexion, else Invalid credentials
- 3/ If connection is accepted, we want to send a cookies with a JWT
      - First, load the `jsonwebtoken` package and import it in a new file users.js in a helpers Folder
      - Declare a private Key in your `.env` and import it in your `helpers/users.js`
      - Create a function with the *email* to create a token (Have a look at the method of jwt) and export it
      - Import the method in the `routes/auth.js` and use it to calculate a token
      - Put it in a cookies method with params (httpOnly : true, expires: 24h)
- 4/ Now, restructure your projet to put the code to check the password in a middleware and keep only the return statement in the route

## Last step Authorization
- 5/ In the `routes/beers.js`, add a route post in it.
- 6/ Implement a middleware in it, to check if the user is correctly connected before going to the post query
- 7/ Do the same to implement the put route and delete with the specific id in params...
